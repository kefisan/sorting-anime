# Comparison of Sorting Algorithms on Anime Dataset
## Project Overview
This project aims to compare the performance of five sorting algorithms on a dataset containing anime destribution information. The goal is to evaluate the speed of each algorithm and determine which is most efficient for this particular dataset with nice, colourful graphs and get sorted data of different size, if needed.

## Algorithms Compared
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Hybrid Sort
## Dataset
The Dataset used in this comparison is the Anime Dataset under CC0 License, which contains 17 columns. Provided code includes sorting rows by the Release Year or Raiting.
